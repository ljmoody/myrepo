# myrepo
A test repo for learning GitHub.
It might not be pretty, but it's something.

The **gh-pages branch** contains markdown files for my Pages site: [https://ljmoody.github.io/myrepo/](https://ljmoody.github.io/myrepo/ "Moody Manual").

# Helpful Quick Access

## Formatting

### Code Blocks

- Use a single backtick immediately before and after text: ``` `example` ```
- Use three backticks immediately before and after text if you want to show the backticks.

### Strikethrough

- For small chunks, use a single tilde before and after text you wish to strikethrough will work: ~I want to draw a line through this text.~

- Use `<strike> and </strike>` to strikethrough a large chunk of information. Like this:

<strike>
  Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
</strike>

### Links

- To link within a gh-pages document, use this coding: `[Text you want linked](#name-of-chapter/section)`, where the name is an exact replica of the heading you're linking to, without any capitalization. 

## Spiffy Alert Icons

> [!NOTE]  
> Highlights information that users should take into account, even when skimming.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.

> [!WARNING]  
> Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.

> [!CAUTION]  
> blah de blah.

> [!TIP]  
> blah de blah

- These might be other options to use. They must have a paragraph space before and after for the icon to show properly.
