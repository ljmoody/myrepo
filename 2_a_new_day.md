# Chapter 1: A New Day

What is the way you start your day? Have you perfected your routine? Some find that beginning the day with a set routine helps the rest of the day fall into place.

## Ways to Start the Day

Are you wondering how to fine tune the beginning of your day? What follows is an example of a morning routine that works for a male relative:

- wake
- drink a cup of coffee ☕️
- exercise, preferably outdoors 🚴‍♀️
- shower 🚿
  - possibly indulge in more coffee
- begin work

### Routine Makes (Some) People Happy

> "The secret of your future is hidden in your daily routine." -Mike Murdock

Some say routine is boring. Others swear by their daily routines. My relative feels just like this when he starts his day off by completing his routine:

## Ways to Approach Life

Bob Ross sure had a unique way of viewing life and mistakes. Some of his kernels of knowledge follow.

### You're in Control

If you don't like it - change it. It's your world. That's crazy. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here.

#### Create What You Love

Maybe there's a happy little Evergreen that lives here. It is a lot of fun. What the devil. You can create anything that makes you happy. Mountains are so simple, they're hard.

If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. All you have to do is let your imagination go wild. Poor old tree. Nice little clouds playing around in the sky. Without washing the brush, add these colors:

- brown
  - Van Dyke Brown
- red/brown
  - Burnt Umber
- green
  - Sap Green

Just take out whatever you don't want. It'll change your entire perspective. Imagination is the key to painting. You create the dream - then you bring it into your world.

##### Happy Little Stones

Of course he's a happy little stone, cause we don't have any other kind. In this world, everything can be happy. We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Don't be bashful - drop me a line. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is.

See there, told you that would be easy. Remember:

- You have to make those little noises or it won't work.
- Everybody's different.
- Trees are different.
- Let them all be individuals.

##### Happy Little Clouds

Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. We touch the canvas, the canvas takes what it wants. A beautiful little sunset. For the lack of a better word I call them hanging downs. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. Isn't it fantastic that you can change your mind and create all these happy things?

> You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow.

## Perspectives

Bob Ross had a unique perspective. What follows is a small collection of things he said while painting. See if you're able to think of things with a unique 'spin' like Bob did.

- When things happen - enjoy them. They're little gifts.
- Painting should do one thing: it should put happiness in your heart.
- Everybody needs a friend.
- Just relax and let it flow.
- You create the dream - then you bring it into your world.
- The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. _Anything._ As long as you **believe**.
